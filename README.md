## Main goals for the v1.0

The main goal for this version is to create an app to access a remote mock server and work with the returned JSON.

```
Actually, the main goals are:
- To apply MVVM architecture correctly.
- Create a Network layer that is easy to implement and expand it if is needed.
- Create a useful and beautiful user interface based only on code files no NIB or story board at all
```
